A complete list of (almost) all my maps created for Stratus, both casual & competitive.
(there are currently no flag football maps here)

All of the maps contain a license, although mainly only the competitive ones have a permission-removal restriction.
If you have any questions about the maps or the license, contact me at Xerocoles#2433 via Discord.
Additionally, I'm willing to give out a different license for the maps depending on what it's for.
